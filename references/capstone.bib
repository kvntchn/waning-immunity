@article{Jones-Eversley_2018,
	abstract = {Some sociologists referred to W.E.B. Du Bois, a 19th century sociologist, as the founding father of American Sociology due to his trailblazing social science research, The Philadelphia Negro. However, The Philadelphia Negro globally revolutionized social science and epidemiological research that expands far beyond sociology and the United States. This study, which was groundbreaking for its era in its implication of social, spatial, intercultural, and intracultural health determinants, authenticated the existence of racial disparities and how systemic inequalities impact health. Du Bois was a social epidemiology frontrunner, yet compared to his contemporaries, acknowledgment of his global contributions to social epidemiology has been practically mute. It is time that Du Bois and Duboisian research are fully acknowledged in the social epidemiology field.},

@article{Lobinska_2022,
	abstract = {The greatest hope for a return to normalcy following the COVID-19 pandemic is worldwide vaccination. Yet, a relaxation of social distancing that allows increased transmissibility, coupled with selection pressure due to vaccination, will probably lead to the emergence of vaccine resistance. We analyse the evolutionary dynamics of COVID-19 in the presence of dynamic contact reduction and in response to vaccination. We use infection and vaccination data from six different countries. We show that under slow vaccination, resistance is very likely to appear even if social distancing is maintained. Under fast vaccination, the emergence of mutants can be prevented if social distancing is maintained during vaccination. We analyse multiple human factors that affect the evolutionary potential of the virus, including the extent of dynamic social distancing, vaccination campaigns, vaccine design, boosters and vaccine hesitancy. We provide guidelines for policies that aim to minimize the probability of emergence of vaccine-resistant variants.},
